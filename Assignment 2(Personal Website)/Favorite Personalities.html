          <h2>Muhammad Ali: The Greatest Boxer of All Time</h2>
          <p>
            Muhammad Ali was an American professional boxer and social activist who is widely regarded as one of the most influential 
            sports figures of the 20th century and the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time. He was born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on 
            January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky. He changed his name to Muhammad Ali after converting to Islam in 1964, following 
            his upset victory over Sonny Liston to win the world heavyweight championship for the first time.
            Ali's boxing style was unique and unconventional. He had a fast jab, quick footwork, and a knack for predicting and avoiding 
            his opponents punches. He also had a charismatic personality and a flair for self-promotion. He often taunted his rivals 
            with rhymes and predictions, such as “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee” and “I am the greatest”. He was also known for 
            his controversial political and religious views, which sometimes caused controversy and criticism.
            He retired from boxing in 1981 with a record of 56 wins(37 by knockout) and 5 losses. He is the only fighter to win the 
            world heavyweight championship three times.
            Ali's legacy transcends boxing and sports.
            Ali died on June 3, 2016, at age 74, after suffering from Parkinson's disease for more than three decades. He is buried at 
            Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. He is remembered as a champion of peace, justice, and humanity, as well as a 
            legendary boxer who inspired millions of people around the world with his skill, spirit, and courage. 
            He is truly “The Greatest".

        <h1>Tamerlane: The Scourge of Asia</h1>
        <p>
          Tamerlane, also known as Timur or Timur the Lame, was a Turco-Mongol ruler and conqueror who founded the Timurid Empire in 
          the 14th century. He was one of the most powerful and feared warlords in history, who led his armies across Asia and Europe, 
          creating a vast empire that stretched from Russia to India, and from Turkey to Mongolia. He is also remembered for his 
          brutality, destruction, and cultural patronage.
          He was injured in his youth, either by an arrow or a fall from a horse, which left him with a limp in his right leg and a 
          paralysis in his right arm. This earned him the nickname Timur-i-Leng or Timur the Lame, which was later corrupted to 
          Tamerlane by Europeans.
          Tamerlane"s ambition was to restore the glory of the Mongol Empire and to claim his own place as a descendant of Genghis 
          Khan. He also sought to spread Islam and to protect it from its enemies, such as the Christian crusaders and the pagan 
          Mongols. He declared himself the amir (commander) of Transoxiana in 1370, after overthrowing the Chagatai Khanate. He then 
          embarked on a series of conquests that lasted for more than three decades.
          Tamerlane"s empire covered most of Asia and parts of Europe at its peak. He conquered Persia (Iran), Iraq, Syria, Anatolia
          (Turkey), Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, 
          Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Mongolia. He fought against various enemies such as the Ottoman Turks , the Mamluks of Egypt,
           the Golden Horde , the Delhi Sultanate , the Ming Dynasty , and the Tokhtamysh Khanate .

        <h1>Khabib Nurmagomedov: The Undefeated UFC Champion(The Eagle)</h1>
        <p>
          Khabib Nurmagomedov is a Russian former professional mixed martial artist who competed in the lightweight division of the 
          Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he was the longest-reigning UFC Lightweight Champion ever, holding the title from 
          April 2018 to March 2021. He retired with an undefeated record of 29 wins and no losses, making him one of the most 
          successful and dominant fighters in the history of mixed martial arts (MMA). He is also widely regarded as one of the 
          greatest grapplers and wrestlers in MMA, as well as a devout Muslim and a proud representative of his native Dagestan.
          He witnessed firsthand the horrors of war and terrorism, which shaped his worldview and his faith. 
          He also developed a passion for martial arts from an early age, following his father's footsteps. He started wrestling at 
          the age of six, and later learned judo and sambo. He also practiced combat sambo, a Russian martial art that 
          combines striking and grappling techniques.

          Khabib made his UFC debut in January 2012, won by submission. He then went on 
          to win his next 12 fights in the UFC. He became the UFC Lightweight Champion in April 2018. He defended his title three times, 
          against McGregor, Poirier, and Gaethje, all by submission. He announced his retirement after his last fight against 
          Gaethje in October 2020, citing his promise to his mother not to fight without his father, who had died earlier that year due to complications from COVID-19.

          Khabib's legacy as a fighter is undeniable. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time, 
          as well as one of the greatest lightweights ever. He holds several records and accolades in the UFC, such as:
          <br>1. The longest undefeated streak in MMA history (29-0)
          <br>2. The longest winning streak in UFC history (13-0)
          <br>3. The most takedowns landed in a single UFC fight (21 against Abel Trujillo )
          <br>4. The most wins by submission in UFC lightweight history (7)
          <br>5. The most dominant performance in a UFC title fight (against McGregor)
          <br>6. The first Muslim to win a UFC title
          <br>7. The first Russian to win a UFC title
          <br>8. The first fighter to be ranked #1 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings
          Khabib's legacy as a person is also remarkable. He is known for his humility, generosity, loyalty, respect, and faith.
