            <h2>Fairy Meadows</h2>
            Fairy Meadows is a beautiful grassland near one of the base camp sites of the Nanga Parbat, the ninth-highest mountain in 
            the world, located in Diamer District, Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan1. It is named by German climbers who called it 
            M√§rchenwiese, meaning ‚Äúfairy tale meadows‚Äù. It is also locally known as Joot. Reaching Fairy Meadows is a bit of a challenge. 
            The journey starts with a jeep ride across one of the most dangerous roads in the world and culminates with a 5 kilometre trek. 
            Jeep ride from Raikot Bridge on Karakoram Highway to the village Tattu (Tato) and then hike for about three to four hours. 
            The jeep road is considered to be one of the most dangerous roads in the world by the World Health Organization.Fairy 
            Meadows offers a stunning view of the Nanga Parbat and its glacier. You can also hike further to the Beyal Camp and the 
            Nanga Parbat Base Camp from Fairy Meadows2. The best time to visit Fairy Meadows is from April to September.Though it has 
            become a bit touristy (and pricey), Fairy Meadows is no doubt a stunner. The meadows offer an incredible view of Nanga 
            Prabat, the world's 9th highest mountain peak. It's possible to rent a campsite, or you can bring your own equipment to enjoy a night or two basking in one of Pakistan's most epic views.</div>

            <h2>Attabad Lake</h2>
            Attabad Lake is a lake located in the Gojal region of Hunza Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It was created in 
            January 2010 as a result of a major landslide in Attabad that blocked the flow of the Hunza River and flooded several 
            villages1. The lake has become one of the main tourist attractions in Gilgit-Baltistan, offering activities such as 
            boating, jet-skiing, fishing and other recreational activities. Attabad Lake is about 21 km (13 mi) long and has a depth 
            of more than 100 m (330 ft), making it one of the highest lakes in the world1. The lake has a stunning crystal blue color 
            that contrasts with the green meadows and snow-capped mountains around it. The lake also submerged a part of the Karakoram 
            Highway, which had to be rebuilt with a tunnel through the landslide dam. Attabad Lake was formed by a natural disaster 
            that killed 20 people and displaced thousands more. The lake also submerged some ancient religious monuments, such as 
            Buddhist stupas, temples and mosques2. The lake is a reminder of the power and beauty of nature, as well as the resilience 
            and adaptability of the local people2.
